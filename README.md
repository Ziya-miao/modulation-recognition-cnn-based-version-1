# research-for-AMC
this project started in 2017/6
adopt python(both of 2.7ver. and 3.5ver.) + Tensorflow + Keras
PLZ use python 2.7ver. to use 'cPackle' first time when loading the dataset
after loading, I choose to 3.6ver. to do my research

after 2015, as the Deep learnig developing rapidly, AMC domain is filled with new power.
rather than using expert features, researchers focus on deep neural network like CNN, whose inputs can be the naive features.
hance this project continues this mainstream to do some research on deep learning in AMC
